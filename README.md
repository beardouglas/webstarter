# Facebook SDK for JavaScript -- Starter package

## Installing

To use this package, you'll need to have an existing Facebook app with an App ID and a domain configured in the App Dashboard at https://developers.facebook.com/apps. Replace the stub app ID and hosting URL in the blankapp.html file, and upload it to a web server.

If you don't have one, you can get set up quickly at no cost with Heroku.
